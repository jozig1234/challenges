Create a program that asks the user for his
name and his age. With that information,
calculate his year of birth.

Output the information to the console
in this format:
Your name is (blank) and you are (blank) years old.
You were born in (blank).

If he is one year old, write 'and you are 1 year old!'.
If he us zero years old, write 'and you are still a baby!'
If he enters a negative number, write 'and I don't speak to time travellers!'. Don't tell
him what year he was born in either.

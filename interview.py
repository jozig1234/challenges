Create a program that asks the user for his
name and his age. With that information,
calculate his year of birth.

Output the information to the console
in this format:
You name is (blank) and you are (blank) years old.
You were born in (blank).

If he is one year old, write 'and you are 1 year old'.
If he us zero years old, write 'and you are still a baby!'
If he enters a negative number, say something mean. Don't tell
him what year he was born in either.

--------------------
What is your name?: manny
How old are you:? 16
Your name is manny and you are 16 years old.
You were born in 1997.
